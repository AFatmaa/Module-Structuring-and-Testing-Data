// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

// Line 3 is performing an assignment, giving a new value to the count variable declared on line 1.
// The new value is the result of the expression on the right side: count + 1.
// So this operation is incrementing the count variable by 1, so after this line, count will now have the value 1.

console.log(`The value of count is now: ${count}`);
