// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);

// Declare the variable before using it in the console log.
// This way, the variable is defined before it's referenced, preventing errors.
